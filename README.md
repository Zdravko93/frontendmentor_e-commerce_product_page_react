### Technologies Used

- React – JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### Features

- Interactive product gallery with lightbox functionality
- Cart functionality with add/remove items
- Thumbnail-based image switching
- Accessible hover and focus states

### What I learned

- Deepened my React skills, especially managing state with Context API
- Improved dynamic UI updates using React Hooks
- Reinforced responsive design principles with Flexbox
- Gained experience structuring a React project with modular CSS
